## Known Issues

- SIFT descriptor computation is approximate; results may differ slightly from OpenCV reference
- Farneback optical flow requires grayscale input; color flow not yet supported
- ICP convergence is sensitive to initial alignment; RANSAC pre-alignment recommended for large misalignments
- Video stabilization requires sufficient texture in scene; textureless scenes may produce artifacts
- Panoptic segmentation API is preliminary; interface may change in v0.4.0
